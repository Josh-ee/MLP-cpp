# MLP-C++
### Overview
This repository hosts a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) implemented from scratch in C++. It was developed as a class project for a Master's level "Programming for Engineers" course.

I embarked on this project to deepen my understanding of Neural Networks and their underlying optimization techniques.

### Features
Implementation of dropout for regularization.
Batch normalization for improved convergence.
Feel free to explore and contribute!
